## ⭐ Who I Am: The Strategy Guy Who Speaks Cloud

Hey, I'm Leroy. For nearly a decade, I've been the person executives call when they need to **turn data into decisions, complexity into clarity, and strategy into revenue**.

But here's the truth: I got tired of *recommending* solutions. I wanted to **build them**.

So I'm rebuilding myself from Strategy & Insights → Cloud Infrastructure. I'm not here to fake 10 years of AWS experience. I'm here to show you what **cross-functional excellence** looks like when a seasoned strategist learns to architect.

**What I bring that pure engineers don't**: I don't just build systems. I build systems that **drive business outcomes** because I've spent 9 years living in the boardroom's headspace.
